<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Naven</h1>

a Computer Science student at Washington State University with a strong passion for Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

My interests lie in applying AI/ML to real-world use cases â€” from building intelligent applications to designing systems that learn, adapt, and improve over time.

Iâ€™m actively seeking opportunities where I can contribute to impactful projects, collaborate with great teams, and keep learning at the cutting edge of technology.
